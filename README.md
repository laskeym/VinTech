# VinTech
Vehicle VIN barcode scanner

VinTech is an Android Application written in Java. 

The apps purpose is to scan a bar code from a motor vehicle which contains the vehicle's VIN number. From here, the app will reach out to the Department of Transportation's Vehicle API and grab the relevant vehicle information granted the VIN is valid. The vehicle information will then be added to a list. The list can be exported as an excel file and individual vehicles can be removed with just a swipe. The list also allows you to manually enter a VIN and will retrieve the vehicle information if the VIN is valid.

VinTech came to be when my cousin and his coworker who work at a car dealership approached me about a tedious, time consuming task they had to complete every month. At the end of each month, they would have to walk to every car in the lot and write down the VIN number associated with that car. They said it could take hours reading the small printed number and there was room for error such as misreading or miscommunication. VinTech plans to solve that problem.

Currently the app is proof of concept. Proper error checking & testing was neglected to push out a usable version of the app. The link provided is the Github repository. If you would like to test the app hands-on, please get in contact with me since the app is not on the Google Playstore yet.

This is my first android app I have built based off a college semester's worth of Java knowledge.
